DESCRIPTION
    This module provide you to simple dispatcher by using PATH_INFO.

    You can set some methods as hashref, PATH_INFO are keys, METHODS are
    values. like:

      '/' => 'default',
      '/list/add' => 'add',

    And, rest of PATH_INFO is saved in $self->args as arrayref. When
    PATH_INFO is '/list/add/foo/bar' in above example, $self->args is:

      [ 'foo', 'bar' ]

    If you define $self->begin or $self->end methods, these are called
    automatically before/after PATH_INFO method.

    And when PATH_INFO is not defined, dispatch to '/' method.

METHODS
    new
    dispatch
